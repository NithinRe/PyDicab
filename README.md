# Python (DiCab)
In this repository, I have uploaded 4 module which includes two real-world examples, one tic tac toe game, and one Numpy&Pandas exercise.
 In the first module, you will see python program about discounts and cashback, when I see some cashback available on Amazon or Flipkart, I used to think how they will provide cashback with a constraint (For example: If you buy any product above 15000 you can avail 10% cashback up to 1500 with SBI Credit Cards ) then I tried to slove in python.
In the second module, you will see about flames, many of you how it works even though I just wanted to try in python.
In the third Module, you will see about Numpy 1-2 Dimensional(matrix) and Pandas, which are available on Coursera provided by IBM professional certificate.
Finally, a fun game when we were kids, I used to play just to pass the time in the classroom.
